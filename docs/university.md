## Course Preparation

Learning material is specially prepared by teams of experts drawn from different universities and specialized
institutions in the area spread throughout the country as well as in-house faculty. The material is scrutinized by the
content experts, in -house faculty and edited by the language experts at IGNOU before these are finally sent for
printing. Similarly, audio and video materials are produced in consultation with the course writers, in- house faculty
and producers. The material is previewed and reviewed by the faculty as well as outside experts and
edited/modified, wherever necessary, before they are finally dispatched to the students, Study Centres and Telecast
through Gyan Darshan.

## Credit System

1. Defining Credit in ODL
   The University follows the ‘Credit System’ for most of its programmes. Each credit in our system is equivalent
   to 30 hours of learner study comprisingall learning activities (i.e., reading and comprehending
   10 IGNOU Common Prospectus-July 2021b)
   the print material, listening to audio, watching video, attending counselling sessions, teleconference and
   writing assignment responses). Thus, a 4-credit course involves 120 hours of study and a 6-credit course
   involves 180 hours of study. This helps the learner to know the academic effort he/she has to put in, to
   successfully complete a course. Completion of an academic programme (Degree or Diploma) requires
   successful completion of the assignments, practical, projects and the Term-End Examination as per
   requirement of each course in a programme.

2. Choice Based Credit System (CBCS)
   The Bachelor’s Degree Programmes offered through this prospectus follow the Choice Based Credit System
   (CBCS) introduced by UGC. The CBCS provides the learner with flexibility to study the subjects/courses at
   their own pace; greater choice of inter-disciplinary, intra-disciplinary and skill-based courses; and mobility to
   different institutions for studies. The system has the following advantages:
   - Allows learners to choose a combination of inter-disciplinary, intra-disciplinary courses, skill oriented
     courses (even from other disciplines according to their learning needs, interests and aptitude).
   - Makes education broad-based and at par with global standards.
     Offers flexibility for learners to study at different times and at different institutions to complete the
     programme. Credits earned at one institution can be transferred to another institution.

## Support Services

In order to provide individualized support to its learners, the University has a large number of Study Centres,
spread across the country. These Study Centres are coordinated by 67 Regional Centres and Recognised Regional
Centres. At the Study Centres, the learners interact with the Academic Counselors and other learners, refer to
books in the Library, watch/listen to video/audio programmes and interact with the Coordinator on administrative
and academic matters. The list of Regional Centres is given in this Prospectus. Support services are also provided
through Work Centres, Programme Study Centres, Skill Development Centres and Special Study Centres.

**In case the number of students enrolled in a program is small, the University shall provide Technology Enabled Learner Support (TELS) through Gyan Darshan / Gyan Vani Swayam**
**Prabha/ Web based support**

## Programme Delivery

The methodology of instruction in this University is different from that of the conventional Universities. The Open
University system is more learner-oriented and the learner is an active participant in the pedagogical (teaching
and learning) process. Most of the instructions are imparted through distance education methodology as per the
requirement.

**The University follows a multimedia approach for instruction, which comprises:**

1. **Self Instructional Printed Material:** The printed study material (written in self-instructional style) for
   both theory and practical components of the programmes is provided to the learners in the form of a single
   print book and/or e-book, comprising blocks and units or in the form of separate printed blocks for every
   course (on an average 1 block per credit). A block which comes in theform of a booklet usually comprises
   3 to 5 units.

2. **Audio-Visual Material Aids:** The learning package contains audio and video programmes which have been
   produced by the University for better clarification and enhancement of understanding of the course material
   given to the learners. A video programme is normally of 25-30 minutes duration. The Video content is available on eGyan kosh (www.egyankosh.ac.in) – the digital learning repository of the University.
   **The video programmes are also telecast on National Network of Gyan Darshan and Swayamprabha channels.** All Gyan Vani stations broadcast curriculum-based audio programmes as per
   their schedule that is notified in advance. In addition, some selected stations of All India Radio also
   broadcast the audio programmes. Learners can confirm the dates for the programmes from their study
   centres. The information is also provided through the university website.

3. **Counselling Sessions:** Normally counselling sessions are held as per schedule drawn by the Study
   Centres. These are mostly held outside the regular working hours of the host institutions where the study
   centres arelocated. **However, in case the number of students in a programme is small, face-to-face counselling shall not be organized. In such cases the University shall** **provide Web Enabled Academic Support to the learners.**

4. **Tele conferences:** Live sessions are conducted via satellite through interactive Gyan Darshan Channel as
   well as simultaneously webcaste athttp://ignouonline.ac.in/and via Facebook Live sessions.

5. **Practicals/Project Work:** Some Programmes have practical/project component also depending upon the
   learning requirements. Practical sessions are held at designated institutions for which schedule is provided
   by the Study Centres. Attendance at practical sessions is compulsory. For project work, comprehensive
   project guide, in the form of a booklet, is provided to the learner along with the study material.

## Web Enabled Academic Support (WEAS)

To provide technology based academic support to the learners of the distance mode programmes, IGNOU has
initiated a scheme of Web Enabled Academic Support (WEAS) for various ODL programmes of IGNOU. WEAS is a
Single Window Platform providing various kinds of academic support including the study material, audio-video,
quiz, discussion forum, calendar of activities, web-based video counselling, links of various web-based resources
to the distance learners by using simple and easily available ICT tools. The students enrolled in programmes being
offered through WEAS are given access to their programme specific portal in which they are provided with course
material in digital format, video and learning resources. The portal enables online peer-to-peer interaction and
discussion, it also gives an opportunity to the students to learn online and interact virtually with teachers and
experts. To access WEAS click the link - https://sites.google.com/ignou.ac.in/weas

## Evaluation System

The system of evaluation followed by the University also is different from that of conventional universities.
IGNOU has a multitier system of evaluation.

1. Self-assessment exercises within each unit of study material.
2. Continuous evaluation mainly through assignments which are tutor-marked, practical assignments
   and seminar/ workshops/extended contact programmes, etc.
3. Term-End Examinations (TEE).
4. Project / Term-end Practical examination.

The evaluation of learners depends upon various instructional activities undertaken by them. A learner has to
write assignment responses compulsorily before taking Term-End Examinations from time to time to complete an
academic programme. A learner has to submit Tutor Marked Assignments (TMA) responses to the Coordinator
of the Study Centre to which s/he is attached. **Term-end examination is conducted at various examination centres spread all over the country and abroad in June and December every year.**

> IGNOU uses the following system of “Grading” for evaluating learners' achievement

| Letter Grade | Qualitative Level | Point Grade |
| :----------: | :---------------: | :---------: |
|      A       |     Excellent     |      5      |
|      B       |     Very Good     |      4      |
|      C       |       Good        |      3      |
|      D       |      Average      |      2      |
|      E       |  Unsatisfactory   |      1      |

For Bachelors’ and Masters’ degree programmes, normally the system of numerical marking is followed, and the
marks secured in assignments, TE Exams, etc. are later converted into grades as per the five-point grading scale
given above. However, if required by the learner, the university provides numerical marks and division (I, II or
Pass).
IGNOU uses 10-Point Grading System for evaluating learners’ achievement for Bachelor Degree
Programmes under CBCS, as under:

> 10-Point Grading System of IGNOU as per UGC-CBCS Guidelines

| Letter Grade      | Numerical Grade |      Percentage |
| :---------------- | :-------------: | --------------: |
| O (Outstanding)   |       10        |         &ge; 85 |
